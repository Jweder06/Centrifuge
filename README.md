# Centrifuge
This is a simple centrifuge using PID to control the speed of the centrifuge. The goal is to be able to get the PID to get to a certin speed and if time allows a rotary encoder will be used to change the goal speed
## Planing
Most of the planning was done in a simple MS paint where the layout of the project was set
