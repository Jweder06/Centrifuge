# Centrifuge
This is a simple centrifuge using PID to control the speed of the centrifuge. The goal is to be able to get the PID to get to a certin speed and if time allows a rotary encoder will be used to change the goal speed
## Planing
Most of the planning was done in a simple MS paint where the layout of the project was set and the functions of each sensor was thought out.

### Schedule 
1. First 2 weeks will be cad and start of construction.
2. Third week will be finishing construction and starting code.
3. Fourth will be getting the stepper and lights to work while making it adaptible to pid.
4. Fith week will be coding pid and tuning.
5. Remaining time will be documentation and finishing other ENG work.
## CAD
This was some of the simplest cad work I have done and required simple mounts and a simple acrylic box that was made in less than a week of CAD work. The goal was to make a simple streamlined design that would allow for easy construction. One element of that is that the walls are independent of the base except for the brackets making it easy to wire test and then place the walls. If the parts were integrated into the walls the assembly would be much more difficult.
## Vials and holder

The vials where made with 3d lines, filled into a surface and the cut to make the vial. That was then transformed into the holder and booleand into the cone to make the vial holder.Finaly the part was lightened to make it cheaper to print and easier to spin up to high speed becasue of a reduced weight.

## Electonics and placement
